## About
This project is an attempt to take all commands from the [Arma 3 wiki](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Category:Scripting_Commands_Arma_3), and save them in a consistent XML format for use in syntax checking.

Converting all commands will take a while since each command is manually converted to XML, with help of a Java-written tool (the tool is not publicly available).

## How-to Use
Coming soon...

## Progress
* About 0.9% commands have been converted.
